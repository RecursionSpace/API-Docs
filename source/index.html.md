# Introduction

The Recursion.Space API is built on [REST](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer) principles. Our API has predictable resource-oriented URLs, accepts [form-encoded](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/POST_(HTTP)#Use_for_submitting_web_forms>) request bodies, returns [JSON-encoded](https://www.json.org/json-en.html) responses, and uses standard HTTP response codes, authentication, and verbs.

API authentication is handled by a unique key generated for your account.

If you need API support or would like to see how others are implementing the platform you will find our staff and community through our Discord server.

# Authentication

> To authorize, use this code:

```shell
# With shell, you can just pass the correct header with each request
curl "https://api.recursion.space/v1/" \
  -H "Authorization: Token YOUR_API_KEY_HERE"
```

> Make sure to replace `meowmeowmeow` with your API key.

Recursion.Space uses API keys to allow access to the API. You can obtain an API key under the developer tab on your dashboard.

Your API key grants privlaged access to your account and by extention spaces, so be sure to keep it secure! Do not share your API keys in publicly accessible areas such as GitHUB, client-side code, and so forth.

`Token: YOUR API KEY HERE`

<aside class="warning">
All API requests must include the API key and be made over HTTPS, requests that do not meet these requirements will fail.

# Language Libraries

Language libraries will be added as they become available, to find community libraries vist Discord.
